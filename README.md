*Project Name:* Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench

*Project Scenario:*
Mint Classics Company is considering closing one of their storage facilities. They seek suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely service to customers. As a data analyst, the task is to analyze the data from the Model Car Database using MySQL Workbench and provide data-driven insights to address the business problem.

*Skills Demonstrated:*
- Data analysis
- SQL querying
- Critical thinking
- Problem-solving
- Communication

*Tools Used:*
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL

*Summary:*
The project involves examining the Model Car Database to identify patterns, conduct what-if analysis, and formulate recommendations. Key tasks include analyzing sales patterns, assessing the impact of inventory reduction, and proposing solutions to optimize inventory management.

*Solution:*
1. *Identification of Patterns:*
   - SQL queries were used to identify top-selling products and analyze sales patterns. For example, the query to identify top-selling products retrieved data from the OrderDetails table grouped by OrderNumber and ProductCode, ordered by total sales.
   - Another query analyzed sales by price range to determine the relationship between price and sales.

2. *What-If Analysis:*
   - A what-if analysis was conducted to assess the impact of reducing inventory by 5%. SQL queries were used to calculate the total quantity reduction and the total sales after the reduction.

3. *Recommendations:*
   - Based on the findings, recommendations were formulated to optimize inventory management and enhance customer service while considering the possibility of closing a storage warehouse. Suggestions included prioritizing stocking of top-selling products, adjusting prices strategically, and evaluating the impact of warehouse closure through scenario analysis.

*Approach:*
- *Understanding the Problem:* Analyzed the business problem and the objectives of Mint Classics Company.
- *Data Exploration:* Examined the Model Car Database structure and identified relevant tables and fields.
- *SQL Querying:* Utilized SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, focusing on sales patterns, inventory levels, and customer orders.
- *Insight Generation:* Derived insights from the data analysis to formulate recommendations addressing the business problem.
- *Documentation:* Prepared a comprehensive report summarizing key findings, recommendations, and SQL scripts used in the analysis.

*Conclusion:*
Through the process of data analysis and SQL querying, actionable insights were generated to assist Mint Classics Company in optimizing inventory management and addressing the challenges associated with potentially closing a storage facility. The project showcases critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and proficiency in SQL, demonstrating the ability to provide valuable solutions to real-world business problems.
